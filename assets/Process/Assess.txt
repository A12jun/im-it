Assess

Understand the environment before touching it.

We begin by analyzing the current state of your infrastructure — not just what exists, but how it behaves.

What This Includes:

Network topology mapping

Hardware inventory and performance evaluation

Firewall and rule audit (pfSense / OPNsense)

Storage health review (ZFS pools, SMART data, replication state)

Backup verification testing (not just checking if backups “exist”)

VLAN and segmentation review

Credential and access control audit

Remote access exposure review

Service dependency mapping (Docker, LXC, VM relationships)

Outcome:

A clear report identifying:

Single points of failure

Security gaps

Performance bottlenecks

Architectural inconsistencies

Upgrade opportunities

We do not guess. We measure first.
