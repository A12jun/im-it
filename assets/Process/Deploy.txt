Deploy

Controlled implementation. No shortcuts.

Deployment is executed methodically, with staged validation.

What This Includes:

Proxmox installation and hardening

ZFS pool creation and tuning

Firewall configuration and IDS/IPS activation

VLAN segmentation enforcement

Service deployment (Plex, Nextcloud, AdGuard, Home Assistant, etc.)

WireGuard VPN setup

SSH key enforcement and credential hardening

Snapshot scheduling

Automated backup configuration

Monitoring and alerting configuration

UPS integration and graceful shutdown policies

Every stage is validated before moving forward.

We reduce attack surface first. Then we enable access.
