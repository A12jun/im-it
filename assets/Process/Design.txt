Design

Engineer the architecture correctly from day one.

Once we understand the environment, we design a clean, documented, scalable architecture.

What This Includes:

Segmented network layout (VLAN strategy)

Firewall rule matrix design

Identity and access control model

Virtualization strategy (Proxmox cluster, LXC vs VM placement)

Storage architecture (TrueNAS layout, RAID-Z planning, snapshot policies)

Backup strategy using 3-2-1 principle

Remote access strategy (WireGuard deployment model)

Service isolation design (Docker bridge vs macvlan, container boundaries)

Future scalability planning

We design for:

Failure tolerance

Hardware expansion

Security-first access

Clean documentation

Outcome:

A blueprint-level infrastructure plan before deployment begins.
